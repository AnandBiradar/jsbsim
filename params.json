{"name":"Jsbsim","body":"### Arktools JSBSim\r\n\r\nThis branch of JSBSim is working on developing tools for control systems engineers to rapidly design autopilots for aircraft and other vehicles. By understanding the linear dynamics of vehicles at various trim conditions, control systems can be easily developed.\r\n\r\nIt currently works on Debian GNU/Linux, Mac OS X (PPC and Intel), and Windows. \r\n\r\nA graphical user interface using QT has also been developed to make this process easier for the end-user. The standard installation packages include the GUI which also has socket communication with flightgear for visualization. For lighter-weight graphics a light-weight openscenegraph based visual is also available if built from source.\r\n\r\n* Instructions for installation: https://github.com/arktools/jsbsim/wiki/Install\r\n* Tutorials: https://github.com/arktools/jsbsim/wiki/Tutorials\r\n* Further documentation on the wiki: https://github.com/arktools/jsbsim/wiki/","tagline":"JSBSim Advanced Trimming Branch","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
