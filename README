JSBSim is a multi-platform, general purpose object-oriented Flight
Dynamics Model (FDM) written in C++. Jon Berndt and Tony Peden began

FDM for FlightGear. JSBSim can also be run in a standalone batch mode
for testing and study. More information on JSBSim can be found at the
JSBSim home page here:
